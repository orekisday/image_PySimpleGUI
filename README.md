### Before starting you should make sure that you have all the libraries installed. In this case I created a vertual environment and a txt file with the exactly [requirements](https://github.com/orekisday/image_PySimpleGUI/blob/main/config/config_GUI.txt) you will need to run the program.

#### Just [download](https://github.com/orekisday/image_PySimpleGUI/blob/main/config/config_GUI.txt) the requirements and run the next command in your terminal:
##### pip install -r config_GUI.txt 

### Since the project consists of a logo of our university, the image with the exact name should be located in your files. Please [download](https://github.com/orekisday/image_PySimpleGUI/blob/main/alatoo_logo.png) the image before running the code!

I have created a mini image editor that is fun to use, and here is how you can use it:

### 1. When you run the code it opens your files where you can choose a png images for editing. You can [download](https://github.com/orekisday/image_PySimpleGUI/tree/main/images) cool images in case you don't have any.

### 2. Choose an image and have fun! You can blur the image, or change its contrast and do more! And after editing you are able to save the edited image. The saved image will be converted into a png file.
